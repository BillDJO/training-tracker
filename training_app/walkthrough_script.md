# Walk‑Through Video Script (Optional)

This outline can be used to record a short video (~3–4 minutes) demonstrating the training tracker app on a mobile device.  Adjust timing and narration to suit your speaking style.

## Opening (0:00–0:20)

* Show the home screen of your phone (Samsung Galaxy S24 FE) and tap the **Training Tracker** icon, illustrating the PWA installed on your home screen.  Mention that the app works offline thanks to its service worker.

## Dashboard Overview (0:20–1:00)

* Landing on the dashboard, briefly explain the **Weekly Volume** chart.  Note how volume is automatically calculated from your logged workouts and helps monitor trends.
* Scroll to the **Personal Records** table.  Point out that each exercise shows the heaviest weight you’ve lifted so far.
* Highlight the dark/light toggle in the top‑right corner and the bottom navigation bar optimised for thumb reach.

## Baseline Wizard (1:00–1:40)

* Tap **Baseline** in the bottom nav.  Describe that this wizard is used during the first week to establish starting loads.
* Demonstrate entering a weight, reps and RPE for the **Goblet Squat**.  Submit the form and show how the next exercise appears automatically.
* Mention that the app calculates an estimated 1RM using the Epley formula and seeds the progression engine.  At the end of the wizard, show the summary table of estimated 1RMs.

## Logging a Workout (1:40–2:40)

* Tap **Workout** in the bottom nav.  Select today’s date and choose an exercise (e.g. **Dumbbell Bench Press**).  Enter weight, reps and RPE, then tap **Add Set**.
* Add another exercise and a few more sets.  Point out that you can remove sets before saving.
* Tap **Save Workout**.  Explain that the workout is posted to the local SQLite database and that the progression for each exercise is updated.  Note that the weekly volume chart and PR board will reflect your new session.

## Vitals Tracking (2:40–3:30)

* Tap **Vitals** in the bottom nav.  Show how to record blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol and bodyweight.  Emphasise that tracking vitals helps manage pre‑hypertension and cholesterol.
* Scroll down to the **Blood Pressure Trends** and **Bodyweight Trend** charts.  Describe how these charts make it easy to observe long‑term improvements alongside your strength data.

## Closing (3:30–4:00)

* Return to the dashboard and summarise: the app combines an evidence‑based training plan, automatic progression, workout logging and health monitoring in a private, offline‑first package.
* Encourage the viewer to follow the quarterly goal‑setting cycle and to consult a healthcare professional if they have any concerns.
* Thank the viewer for watching.
